# SPAM-Classifier-
School Project

Spam refers to unwanted email, often in the form of advertisements. In the literature, an email that is not spam is called ham. Most email providers offer automatic spam filtering, where spam emails will be moved to a separate inbox based on their contents. Of course this requires being able to scan an email and determine whether it is spam or ham, a classification problem. This is the subject of this assignment.
